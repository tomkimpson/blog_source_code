Throughout my research I have written a number of scientific codes, typically relating to time-frequency modelling and signal analysis of non-linear, dynamical astrophysical systems. In order to enable [reproducible research](http://reproducibleresearch.net) I am attempting to make all codes associated with published papers publicly available with documentation. This endeavour is currently a work in progress! Please see [github](https://github.com/tomkimpson) for a list of all public repositories.


* [ML4L](https://github.com/tomkimpson/ML4L). Machine learning for land surface modeling. 

* [Iliad](https://github.com/tomkimpson/Iliad). What is the timing signal from a pulsar in a strong-field relativistic environment?

* [Orbital Dynamics](https://github.com/tomkimpson/Orbital-Dynamics). Numerical modelling of spinning objects in a curved spacetime via MPD formalism.

* [Quadrupole Orbital Dynamics](https://github.com/tomkimpson/QuadrupoleSpinCurvatureDynamics). More spin-curvature dynamics, but this time for a metric with a arbitrary mass quadrupole.

* [RayTracing](https://github.com/tomkimpson/RayTracing). In a Kerr spacetime

* [GW_bursts](https://github.com/tomkimpson/GW_Bursts). Numerical kludge gravitational waveforms and SNRs for pulsar in extreme mass ratio systems.
