My research interests to date primarily been in relativistic astrophysics, strong-field gravity and numerical methods. I am particularly interested in the use of pulsars as high precision, multi-messenger probes of relativity in the strong field regime. 

Recently I have also become interested in the application of computer science and information theory to climate modelling; the use of [mixed-precision arithmetic](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2018/10/09/mixed-precision-a-strategy-for-new-science-opportunities/) and machine learning methods in connection with emerging hardware for exascale computing of the next-generation of climate models.
